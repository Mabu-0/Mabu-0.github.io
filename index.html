          <p>Welcome to my First Website Project! First, let me introduce myself. My name is Mario Bucek and I want to become the second best software developer, that works by day and sleeps by night. Why second best, you ask? Because Bruce Wayne wants to became the wery best! I'm hardcore, but I ain't competin' with Batman! Here, a list of some of my achievemnts:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Own nothing and pretend to be happy, just like Master Orwell wrote in 1984</li>
            <li>Defeated my disability and learned to live in a world not made for the disabled</li>
            <li>Fought to get out of the bed on Sunday morning</li>
            <li>Looking bad enough to trip Discord's malware protection when trying to upload a profile foto, LoL!</li>
          </ul>
